# Optimization-for-LEO-satellites-network
The current generation of LEO constellations assumes that each LEO satellite covers a ground area regardless of the number of end users or terminals operating in the same area. The satellite solution to the communication problem, both in terms of reach and quality, is lacking when we talk about optimization in QoS aspects. (latency and throughput  The questions our project deals with are What are the requirements for the QoS? What QoS can we provide with efficient routing in the given constellation? How to maximize the number of users for a specific region and QoS? How many satellites will suffice for the desired QoS in the given constellation?  In addition to the geographical difficulties of routing, there is a delay time problem and therefore the processing time of the routing algorithm has a great impact. The problem the project will deal with is traffic routing for a satellite network based on LEO satellites, considering various service metrics.
